# Sticky-Notes (functional programming) in Vanilla JavaScript

A practical application that I use to learn some of the JavaScript concepts. Allows you to add questions along with the answers, 
working perfectly at all resolutions. Written in "***Vanilla***" **JavaScript** (_no frameworks!_) in **functional programming**,
with the maximum control of side effects.

## Libraries used

* **Ramda** - awesome library built to leverage Functional Programming Concepts
* **Hyperscript** - to generate html and css
* **Webpack/Babel** - I have configured the minimum build system using webpack, babel and several related plugins
* **Virtual-Dom** - to efficiently update webpages

### Others

* NPM Scripts - to configure a simple page-building process. NPM allows me to execute task sequences after the project is completed, 
like compilation **SASS**, prefixing, compressing
